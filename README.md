## Overview

The Aerial Scan Sentinel is a machine learning (ML) project aimed at developing a system for assessing landing safety on Earth's surface using satellite imagery and computational methods. The project's objective is to determine suitable landing spots for drones, helicopters, or similar aerial vehicles by analyzing terrain features.

## Features

- Analyzes satellite imagery to assess landing safety.
- 
- 
- 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aerial-landing-safety.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your aerial images for assessment.
2. Run the main script to assess landing safety:

3. The script will output the input image with safe landing spots labeled.
